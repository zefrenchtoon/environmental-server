# environmental-server
NodeJS project to work with environmental-sensor project

The aim of this project is to develop a small REST service working with the environmental-sensor.

Le REST service will let the sensor inject new data in database, client asking for values stored in database and finally, in a short future I hope, get access to a webapp the show the statistics using graphs, plots etc.

It will be able to manage different sensors, TeleInfo etc.

Work in progress ...

This is my first attempt to NodeJS development so if you want to give me advices / help me, you're welcome !  :)
